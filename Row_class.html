 						<div class="col"> <b>col 1-></b> Lamborghini is an Italian luxury brand, most famous for their sports cars. The company was founded in 1963 by Ferruccio Lamborghini, in an effort to complete with other brands such as Ferrari. The Miura sports coupe, released in 1966, brought the brand much deserved attention. Lamborghini grew rapidly for 10 years until 1973 brought an oil and financial crisis. Ownership changed hands and in 1978 the company went bankrupt. The Mimrans purchased Lamborghini and took it from receivership to a big expansion. It sold in 1987 to Chrysler Corporation. In 1994 it sold to Mycom Setdco and V'Power, and then again in 1998 to Volkswagen Group. It is owned by Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. today, which is a subsidiary of AUDI AG.</div> <!-- col always row k inside hi hoga -->
 						<div class="col"> <b>col 2-></b> Ferruccio Lamborghini didn't start out making luxury sports cars. He got his start making tractors. The tractor company Lamborghini Trattori still exists today, but not by the same company that owns the luxury brand Lamborghini.
Lamborghinis are named after bulls because the company founder was born under the astrological sign Taurus, which is represented by a bull.
Ferruccio Lamborghini was inspired to make cars after learning his Ferrari clutch was a tractor clutch. When he asked Ferrari for a replacement the company told him that as tractor manufacturer he didn't have a clue about cars. So Ferruccio decided to prove them wrong. Some accounts say Ferruccio spat on the floor before storming out of Ferrari.</div>
